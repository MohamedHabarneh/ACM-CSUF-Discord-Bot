# Now that we have a basic understanding of client events, let's go a little further.
# As of now, when a member joins, a message is outputted into the terminal. Our goal now,
# is to assign a member to a role once they join. We want to assign the new member to a role where they
# have very few permissions.

# TO DO:
# - Create a role in your discord server
# - Alter the body of your 'on_member_join' client event to meet our goal

# Hints/Help:
# - If you aren't familiar with creating roles on Discord -> https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/206029707-Setting-Up-Permissions-FAQ
# - CTRL+F "discord.utils.get" on the Discord.py API Reference, you'll use this function to store your desired role into a variable
# - CTRL+F "add_roles" on the Discord.py API Reference, you'll use this function to add a member to your desired role
# - "discord.utils.get" might seem tricky to understand at first but there are a few examples of how to use it in the
# documentation

# Good Luck :)
